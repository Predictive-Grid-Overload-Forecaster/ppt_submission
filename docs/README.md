# ⚡ Delhi Predictive Energy Demand Forecasting

## 🚨 Problem Statement
Delhi faces frequent energy demand surges during extreme weather, especially summer heatwaves.  
These sudden spikes overload the power grid, leading to **blackouts** and cascading failures in **water supply, drainage, and transport**.  

Current grid operations are **reactive**, which results in:
- Inefficiencies in balancing load  
- Emergency power procurement at high costs  
- Large-scale disruptions to urban services  

---

## 💡 Our Solution
We developed a **predictive energy demand forecasting system** that integrates multiple modeling approaches to ensure robustness and accuracy.  

The system learns from **historical hourly electricity consumption** and incorporates external drivers such as:
- 🌦 **Weather forecasts** → temperature, humidity, solar radiation, wind speed  
- 📅 **Calendar effects** → public holidays, weekends, festivals, major city events  
- 🔁 **Lagged demand features** → yesterday’s same hour, last week’s same hour  

### 🔬 Modeling Approaches
- 🤖 **LSTM (Deep Learning)** → captures long-term temporal dependencies for 48-hour ahead demand forecasting  
- 📈 **Prophet (Classical ML)** → interpretable model that handles **trend, seasonality, and holidays** effectively  
- 🌳 **XGBoost (Tree-Based ML)** → strong tabular learner that leverages engineered features for **fast & accurate predictions**  

By combining these models, we achieve **high precision forecasts** while ensuring **transparency and reliability**.

## 🎯 Value Proposition
- ⚡ **Fewer Blackouts** → Anticipates demand spikes before they happen, enabling proactive grid balancing  
- 💰 **Cost Savings** → Optimizes energy distribution and reduces emergency procurement  
- 🏙️ **Urban Resilience** → Prevents cascading crises (**power → water → transport**)  
- ✅ **Robustness & Trust** → Benchmarked across **Deep Learning (LSTM)**, **Classical Time-Series (Prophet)**, and **ML (XGBoost)**
