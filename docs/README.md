# ⚡ Predictive Grid Overload Forecaster

---

## 📝 Problem Statement
Delhi faces frequent **energy demand surges** during extreme weather, especially summer heatwaves.  
This leads to **grid overload**, risking blackouts and cascading failures in critical infrastructure such as **water pumping** and **drainage systems**.  

Current systems are **reactive**, resulting in inefficiencies and large-scale service disruptions.

---

## 🤖 Our Solution
We developed an **LSTM-based predictive energy demand forecaster** that learns from historical hourly electricity consumption and integrates external drivers:

- 🌡 **Weather forecasts**: temperature, humidity, solar radiation, wind speed  
- 📅 **Calendar effects**: public holidays, weekends, festivals, major city events  
- ⏱ **Lagged demand features**: yesterday’s same hour, last week’s same hour  

🔮 By combining these signals, our AI model predicts **zonal-level energy demand for the next 48 hours** with high accuracy — enabling **proactive grid management**.

## 💡 Value Proposition
- ⚡ **Fewer Blackouts** – anticipates demand spikes before they happen  
- 💰 **Cost Savings** – optimizes distribution & reduces emergency procurement  
- 🌆 **Urban Resilience** – prevents cascading crises (power → water → transport)
